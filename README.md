## Repository Overview  

Welcome to the **Java Projects** repository! This repository contains various Java projects I have worked on. Currently, it includes two projects:  

1. **Discrete Event Simulation**: A project that simulates discrete event systems, allowing for modeling and analysis of event-driven systems.  
2. **SICXE Assembler**: A simple assembler project that takes assembly code and compiles it into machine-level instructions.
